### my attempt on understanding node.js streams

thanks to @substack for making this so easy! 

to play on your own, install `npm install -g stream-adventure`

my solutions are in the corresponding files, feel free to look at my crappy js... also, sometimes I ended up with totally different approaches... secretz seems to be on of them.

to run the solutions, install with npm and select with `stream-adventure`

    npm install 
    stream-adventure # select puzzle
    stream-adventure verify # selected puzzle name *.js
